#This code block is nearly identical to the one we used in Step 2, but it has two key differences:
#We now pass timeout=0.00001 to get_wiki_page_existence. Since the requests package wonâ€™t be able to complete its web request to Wikipedia in 0.00001 seconds, it will raise a ConnectTimeout exception.
#We catch ConnectTimeout exceptions raised by future.result() and print out a string each time we do so.
